Original Addon is: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=309299668 (_TTT - Martyrdom (CoD Perk)_)   
my version of it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899206223 (_TTT - Martyrdom (sound warning)_)

- I added a sound warning. It sounds like a grenade bounce.                                                     
The grenade bounce sound is from https://freesound.org/people/MultiMax2121/sounds/156896/ (CC0 - No Copyright).   
I hat to cut it a little bit so that it fit to the time after which it will explode.

- The Martyrdom will also be buyable by the Detective.
